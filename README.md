# Week 7 Challenge
## Build an existing page from scratch

---------

This project was an optional 48-hour challenge as part of the Generation Australia / Academy Xi Junior Web Developer Programme.

Using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, and provided with only the images, the challenge was to create a page that looks and behaves like that of an existing template.
